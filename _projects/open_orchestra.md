The Open Orchestra is the musical equivalent of an aircraft simulator, providing student musicians a high-fidelity ensemble performance experience. As part of that project, this research developed methods of computer analysis and visualization for feedback and comparison. To identify measures of interest, the software compares the pitch and timing of a student's performance with that of the original musician playing the same part.

A study on the efficacy of visualizations as feedback was presented at the Visualization and Data Analysis conference in January 2012.
