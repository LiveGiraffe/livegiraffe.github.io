My goal in this project was to experiment with different sensor types, musical instrument design, synthesis mappings and Arduino programming.

There are three play surfaces on the Onaip and whichever is facing upwards is active:

- three force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) for percussive playing
- eight push buttons to be paired with a breath sensor for potential as a woodwind-like controller
- three linear positions sensors for chords and glissando
