Inspired by Iannis Xenakis' UPIC, Draw Music is a software program that allows the user to draw on a rectangular canvas and play it back. Sound is created from the drawing with left to right representing time and top to bottom representing low to high frequency. 

The functionality is quite simple but the fine grained control means the only limit to the acoustic control is the resolution of the drawing canvas. With practice and an increased toolset, like any highly-skilled instrument, it should be able to produce very interesting and nuanced music.
