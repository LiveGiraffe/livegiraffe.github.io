- Noteloop was a small startup based out of Ottawa, Canada. While I was there I worked on music information retrieval algorithms, code for manipulating and translating different types of music data, audio signal processing, implementing GUI elements and more. Everything was written in cross-platform C++ using the JUCE framework. 

- The company has pivoted a few times since I worked there and the product I worked on is not currently available. The above screenshot is copyright Noteloop Systems, Inc and was retrieved from Archive.org.
